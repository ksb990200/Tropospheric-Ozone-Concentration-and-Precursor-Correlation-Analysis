# Tropospheric-Ozone-Concentration-and-Precursor-Correlation-Analysis
Analysis of the correlation between Tropospheric ozone and its precursors (CO, NO2) using NASA's Giovanni data. This project applies Python for data visualization and Spearman's correlation, providing insights into environmental chemistry.

### Project Overview
This project explores the correlation between Tropospheric ozone concentration and its precursor chemicals, specifically Carbon Monoxide (CO) and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2). Utilizing data from NASA's Giovanni website, this analysis aims to understand the impact of these chemicals on ozone levels and, by extension, their potential environmental and health implications.

### Data Source
The data for this study was sourced from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) aboard NASA's Aura satellite and the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) aboard the Aqua satellite. The analysis focuses on the monthly averaged data for the year 2022, examining variations in precursor chemical concentrations and their correlation with ozone levels in the Troposphere across different locations including Thiruvananthapuram, Bay of Bengal, Karwar, Nagpur, Ahmedabad, and Kanpur.

### Methodology
The study employs scatter plots and error bars to visualize the data, allowing for the observation of relationships between continuous variables. The Spearman Correlation Coefficient method is used to analyze the data, focusing on the ranks of data rather than their raw values to determine the correlation between variables.

### Results
The analysis reveals a positive correlation between Tropospheric ozone concentration and the concentrations of its precursor chemicals, CO and NO2. Notably, the correlation with CO is stronger than with NO2. This variation can be attributed to several factors, including the role of excess CO in ozone depletion through certain chemical reactions.

### Conclusion
The study concludes that there is a significant positive correlation between the concentrations of precursor chemicals and Tropospheric ozone. The stronger correlation with CO suggests its more pronounced role in affecting ozone levels. The findings highlight the importance of monitoring these precursor chemicals to manage and mitigate their impact on ozone concentrations and environmental health.
